## About

This project implements black-box monitoring using synthetic probes.

The metrics tell the health of the service, exposing metrics that help us define the SLI.
Based on these, we can establish SLOs related to Availability, latency and error rates.

Prometheus is used for metrics aggregation and grafana for visualizations.
